# ADR-013: BIAN as the Canonical Reference Model for Capability Alignment

> **Status:** ✅ Accepted

## Summary

* **Decision:** Use BIAN (Banking Industry Architecture Network) Service Landscape v13 as the canonical reference model for capability alignment.
* **Chosen approach:** BIAN as semantic backbone, validated mappings, BIAN-DDD alignment.
* **Why:** Without a stable reference model, modernization produces structural change without semantic clarity. BIAN provides industry-standard vocabulary.
* **Scope:** This ADR covers reference model choice. BIAN loading is an implementation detail.

## Context

When legacy systems are modernized without a stable reference model:
- New names for old things
- Organizational accidents preserved
- Inconsistent vocabulary
- No external validation

BIAN provides:
- **327 Service Domains** — Comprehensive banking coverage
- **Functional Patterns** — Fulfill, Manage, Process, etc.
- **Industry adoption** — Recognized standard in banking

---

## Decision

We will use **BIAN as the canonical reference model**:

### BIAN-DDD alignment

| BIAN Concept | DDD Concept | Relationship |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Service Domain | Bounded Context | 1:1 |
| Control Record | Aggregate Root | 1:1 |
| Behavior Qualifier | Sub-Aggregate | Part of BC |
| Functional Pattern | Service Type | Informs design |

### Mandatory mapping

All capabilities must map to BIAN:
```cypher
(:Capability)-[:MAPS_TO]->(:BIANServiceDomain)
```

Unmapped capabilities trigger validation failure.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Stable target taxonomy
- Industry-standard vocabulary
- Supports DDD alignment

### Negative Consequences

- Mapping is semantic work
- Not all edge cases covered
