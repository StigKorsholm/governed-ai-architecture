# ADR-008: Human Checkpoints as Architectural Control Points

> **Status:** ✅ Accepted  
> **Date:** 2025-12-22  
> **Triggered By:** ADR-000 (consequence: "Some decisions cannot be safely automated")  
> **Triggers:** ADR-009, ADR-017

## Summary

* **Decision:** Introduce explicit human checkpoints (CP-1 to CP-4) where execution pauses for review. Migration checkpoint (CP-3) requires maker-checker (two-person rule). All decisions and overrides are recorded.
* **Chosen approach:** Defined checkpoint locations, review queues with confidence-based prioritization, auditable approvals.
* **Why:** Full automation is not the goal in regulated environments. Controlled automation is. Some decisions require human judgment and accountability.
* **Scope:** This ADR covers checkpoint philosophy and structure. Review UI/UX is an implementation detail.

## Context

Not all decisions can be safely automated:
- **Semantic judgments** — Is this BIAN mapping correct?
- **Risk acceptance** — Is this migration plan safe?
- **Override authorization** — Who approved this deviation?

Human checkpoints are not exceptions to automation — they are **architectural control points**.

---

## Decision

We will implement **human checkpoints as architectural control points**:

### Checkpoint definitions

| Checkpoint | After Phase | Review Focus | Approval Rule |
|------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **CP-1** | Capability derivation | Completeness, naming | Single reviewer |
| **CP-2** | BIAN mapping | Accuracy, coverage | Single reviewer |
| **CP-3** | Migration planning | Safety, dependencies | **Maker-checker** |
| **CP-4** | Final delivery | Report quality | Single reviewer |

### Review queue prioritization

| Confidence | Priority | Requirement |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| < 0.70 | High | Must review |
| 0.70 - 0.84 | Medium | Should review |
| ≥ 0.85 | Low | Spot check |

### Audit requirements

All checkpoint interactions produce audit records with identity, timestamp, decision, and any overrides with justification.

---

## Decision Rationale

> Automation without governance is not efficiency. It's deferred failure.

## Consequences

### Triggered ADRs

| Consequence | Triggers |
|-------------|----------|
| Some phases require stricter governance | ADR-009 |
| Corrections must be captured for learning | ADR-017 |

### Positive Consequences

- Banking-grade governance
- Clear accountability
- Overrides are documented

### Negative Consequences

- Process overhead (review takes time)
- Requires reviewer availability
