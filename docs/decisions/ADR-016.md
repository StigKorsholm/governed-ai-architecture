## Summary

* **Decision:** Every final report must include an Evidence Appendix containing validation results, confidence distribution, assumptions, and traceability queries.
* **Chosen approach:** Mandatory appendix sections, structured format, executable queries.
* **Why:** Reports without evidence are opinions. Evidence makes them auditable and verifiable.
* **Scope:** This ADR covers evidence requirements. Report body structure is flexible.

## Decision

Every Evidence Appendix must include:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Validation Summary** | Pass/fail/warn counts by validator |
| **Confidence Distribution** | Histogram of confidence scores |
| **Assumptions** | What wasn't verified |
| **Traceability Queries** | Cypher queries to verify claims |
| **Review Summary** | Checkpoint approvals, overrides |
| **Limitations** | Explicit scope boundaries |

### Traceability queries example

```cypher
// Verify all tables are mapped
MATCH (t:Table)
WHERE NOT (t)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:Capability)
RETURN count(t) AS orphan_tables
// Expected: 0
```

## Decision Rationale

> An architecture recommendation without evidence is an opinion. Evidence transforms it into a defensible position.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Audit-ready deliverables
- Claims are verifiable
- Assumptions are explicit

### Negative Consequences

- Reports are longer
- Requires discipline to maintain
